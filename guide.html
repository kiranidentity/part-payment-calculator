                <h2>How Part Payments Work</h2>
                <p>
                    A <strong>Part Payment</strong> (or Prepayment) is any amount you pay towards your loan
                    <em>over and above</em> your regular EMI.
                </p>
                <div class="intro-info" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    <p><strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> Every rupee of your part payment is deducted directly from your
                        <strong>Outstanding Principal</strong>. It does not go towards interest.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                    Since interest is calculated on the remaining principal, a lower principal means significantly
                    lower interest in all subsequent months. This creates a snowball effect that drastically reduces
                    your loan tenure.
                </p>

                <h2>3 Key Benefits</h2>
                <div class="benefits-grid">
                    <div class="benefit-card">
                        <h3>📉 Interest Savings</h3>
                        <p>This is the biggest win. On long-term loans like Home Loans, you often pay more in interest
                            than the loan amount itself. Part payments can slash this interest burden by 30-50%.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="benefit-card">
                        <h3>⏳ Freedom of Time</h3>
                        <p>Most banks keep your EMI constant when you make a prepayment. This means your loan gets paid
                            off much faster. You could be debt-free in 12-15 years instead of 20.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="benefit-card">
                        <h3>🧠 Mental Peace</h3>
                        <p>Being debt-free brings immense mental peace. Closing a home loan early frees up your monthly
                            income for retirement savings, children's education, or travel.</p>

                <h2>Real-World Example: The Power of ₹5,000</h2>
                <p>Let's take a typical scenario for an Indian Home Loan borrower to see how small actions create big
                    results.</p>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <div class="example-details">
                        <p><strong>Loan Amount:</strong> ₹50,00,000 (50 Lakhs)</p>
                        <p><strong>Interest Rate:</strong> 8.5%</p>
                        <p><strong>Tenure:</strong> 20 Years</p>
                        <p><strong>Standard EMI:</strong> ₹43,391</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="example-outcome">
                        <h4>Impact of paying just ₹5,000 extra/month:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Interest Saved:</strong> <span class="highlight-green">₹14.5 Lakhs!</span></li>
                            <li><strong>Time Saved:</strong> <span class="highlight-green">5 Years 4 Months!</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="example-note">Instead of paying for 20 years, you are free in just ~14.5 years. That's
                            the power of consistent part payments.</p>
