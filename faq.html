                    <h3>1. Do banks charge a penalty for part payments?</h3>
                    <p>For <strong>floating rate</strong> individual home loans, RBI has mandated zero prepayment
                        penalties. However, for fixed-rate loans or business loans, banks may charge a small fee
                        (usually 0.5% - 2%). Always check your loan agreement.</p>

                    <h3>2. Is it better to reduce EMI or Tenure?</h3>
                    <p>Without a doubt, <strong>reducing Tenure</strong> is financially superior. Reducing tenure saves
                        you lakhs in compound interest. Reducing EMI primarily helps with monthly cash flow but doesn't
                        offer significant long-term savings.</p>

                    <h3>3. How accurate is this calculator?</h3>
                    <p>This calculator uses standard amortization logic used by most Indian banks. However, exact
                        figures may vary slightly due to difference in days-count conventions (360 vs 365 days) used by
                        different lenders.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>4. When is the best time to make a part payment?</h3>
                    <p>The best time is <strong>as early as possible</strong>. Interest is highest in the initial years
                        of the loan. A pre-payment made in the 1st year saves 5x more money than the same amount paid in
                        the 15th year.</p>

                            server.</strong> Your financial details remain 100% private and on your device.</p>

                    <h3>6. Can I use this for Car Loans or Personal Loans?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. While the example uses a Home Loan, the math works the same for Personal and Car
                        loans. Just enter your specific Interest Rate (e.g., 10-14% for Car, 11-20% for Personal).</p>
